# Installing Julia

The recommended way to install julia is [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). It allows you toe.g.  easily update Julia at a later point, but also test out alpha/beta versions etc.

TLDR; If you dont want to read the explicit instructions, just copy the following command

### Windows
AppStore -> JuliaUp,  or `winget install julia -s msstore` in CMD

### Mac & Linux
`curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh` in any shell

# VSCode
To install VSCode (the recommended IDE), go to [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download + install the correct package.

Next, install the Julia extension
