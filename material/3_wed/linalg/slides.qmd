## Slides

The slides are available [in pptx format here](Julia_Matrices_Optimization_JuMP_Stuttgart2023.pptx). Note that there are a few extra slides in case you are motivated to learn more!

## Exercise

The exercise is rendered [as html here](Julia_Matrices_Optimization_JuMP_Stuttgart2023.ipynb) but can also be downloaded {{< downloadthis Julia_Matrices_Optimization_JuMP_Stuttgart2023.ipynb label="Download as ipynb" >}}

Before starting the exercise, please download the files [Manifest.toml](Manifest.toml) and [Project.toml](Project.toml), put the files in the same folder that \*.ipynb file is located.

Start Julia in that directory and run the following commands:

```{julia}

using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()

```

Now, you are ready to open the notebook in VSCode or alternatively in the same Julia console that you used for installation. You can run the following commands:

```{julia}

using IJulia; notebook(dir=".")

```
