#Multiple Regression Basics

## Motivation

### Introductory Example: tree dataset from R

[figure raw data]

*Aim:* Find relationship between the *response variable* `volume`  and the *explanatory variable* `girth`?
Can we predict the volume of a tree given its girth?

[figure including a straight line]

First Guess: There is a linear relation!
