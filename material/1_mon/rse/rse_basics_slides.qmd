# Introduction to Research Software Engineering

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Starting Points

-   [DORA declaration](https://sfdora.org/) in 2012: reshape how research impact should be assessed underlining importance of software

> For the purposes of research assessment, consider the value and impact of all research outputs (including datasets and software) in addition to research publications ...

-   [UK survey in 2014](https://zenodo.org/record/1183562): 7 out of 10 researchers could not conduct research without software.
-   [DFG funding calls on research software sustainability](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/infrastructure/lis/funding_opportunities/call_proposal_software/) in 2016 & 2019 & 2023
-   [Nationale Forschungsdaten Infrastruktur, NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en) since 2020
-   Lack of careers for software developers in academia
-   Lack of reproducibility of research that uses software (*"works for me on my machine"* vs. *"works for everyone everywhere"*)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RSE Movement

... academic software developers needed a name: **Research Software Engineers**

[UK Society of RSE](https://society-rse.org/):

> A Research Software Engineer (RSE) combines professional software engineering expertise with an intimate understanding of research.

-   *"Movement"* started in the UK, first UK RSE conference in 2016
-   First conferences in Germany and the Netherlands in 2019
-   [de-RSE position paper](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-295/v2) in 2020
-   Second Thursday of October is the [International RSE Day](https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html)
-   [Why be an RSE?](https://researchit.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2021/10/14/international-rse-day-why-be-an-rse/) Interesting and novel projects, technical freedom, RSEs come from varied backgrounds, development for social good

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Do I need this in Industry?

-   Yes. Research also happens in industry.
-   All RSE things we learn (Git, packaging, CI/CD, virtualization, documentation, ...) is also highly relevant for non-research software.
-   Companies use (more and more) the same workflows and tools.
    -   It is not just about coding. It is about collaborative work.
-   Open-source development excellent door opener for industry.
-   Some companies use open-source software and need to make contributions.
-   Some companies develop their software as open-source software.
