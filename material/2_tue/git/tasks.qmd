# Tasks

1. Work with any forge that you like and create a user account (we strongly recommend GitHub since we will need it later again).
2. Push your package `MyStatsPackage` to a remote repository.
3. Add a function `printOwner` to the package through a pull request. The function should print your (GitHub) user name (hard-coded).
4. Start a new Julia environment and use your package through its url: `]add https://github.com/[username]/MyStatsPackage`.
5. Now use the package from somebody else in the classroom instead and verify with `printOwner` that you use the correct package.
6. Fork this other package and contribute a function `printContributor` to it via a PR. Get a review and get it merged.
7. Add more functions to other packages of classmates that print funny things, but always ensure a linear history.
